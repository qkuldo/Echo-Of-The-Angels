     After finishing years of training in exile, far away from your colonized country, you have to prove yourself worthy of being the Hero of your kingdom.
 To do this, you must obtain the 4 Magical Crests of the Hero, guarded by powerful deities who protect these Crests.

Monster
 These are the monsters found in this dungeon
 -Slime
   15 HP 5 DMG 1 SPEED
   These cute, slimy bastards are very common around here.
   They usually wander around in packs, but some like traveling on their own.
   A pack of Slimes is called a Glob Ball. Slimes are weak, but you can sneak behind them.
 -Corrupted Golem
   25 HP 8 DMG 1 SPEED
   Despite its height, these tall golems are the weakest of its brothers.
   It was corrupted by one of the deities in the dungeon to help them protect the Crests.
   Tall in height, they can easily spot you from far away. Their arms have been destroyed, so they stomp intruders to death.
