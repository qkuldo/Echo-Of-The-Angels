Monsters
 These are the monsters found in this dungeon
 -Slime
   15 HP 5 DMG 1 SPEED
   These slimes are a type unique to this region.
   Called the Sobbing Slimes, they posses regions that are teal in color under their eyes that increase in size and brightness when hurt.
   Yeah and theyre also shaped like one i guess.
   The reason they have these regions is to discourage predators from attacking them by giving them pity and empathy for the slimes.
 -Corrupted Golem
   25 HP 8 DMG 1 SPEED
   Despite its height, these tall golems are the weakest of its brothers.
   It was corrupted by one of the deities in the dungeon to help them protect the Crests.
   Tall in height, they can easily spot you from far away. Their arms have been destroyed, so they stomp intruders to death.
